                  <p>We reap the benefits of facial recognition to unlock our phone swiftly or to identify 3,000 missing children in four days in a mass shooting at the Capital Gazette. However, past airport security screening, contract tracing, and identifying trafficked people, the system has detrimental consequences to people of color within the criminal justice system. 
                  </p>
                  <p>One ethical problem in the algorithm is that it’s fed data by people with inherited implicit bias. White and middle-aged men are the most represented, while women, children, elderly, and dark skin faces have high error rates. This is because poor-quality images are used under dim lighting, angled faces, or mild accessory disguises. Thus, dark skin faces are misidentified at rates 5 to 10 times higher than those against white faces. For example, Black women were misclassified through facial analysis thirty-five percent of the time, whereas white men nearly always got it correct, about ninety-nine percent of the time. Native Americans are also included as they are the most unrepresented database. In the US, where the criminal justice system historically has been recently biased towards Black and brown people, those images mostly come from overrepresented mugshots. Without verifying the algorithmic accuracy, this has led to “..unfair and inequities when seeking employment, securing a loan, and, most egregiously, being misidentified for a crime.” (Nysba.org). People with an incarcerated background are already impacted by employment opportunities, which may cause recidivism.
                    Furthermore, surveillance threatens the right to assemble and freely express peacefully. Most recently during the Black Lives Matter protests, AI was used to track people in crowds to “intimidate and harass law abiding residents” (Amnesty). In reality, these people, primarily Black and Brown, were protesting to deconstruct an oppressive system that the police participated in.
                    </p>
                    <p> Overrepresented mugshots cause Black and Hispanic people are matched more frequently on facial recognition. These mugshots are derived from prior racial bias arrests. An egregious example is how white and Black people equally use Cannabis. Yet, Black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts. The Black presence in these systems creates a positive feedback loop where policing strategies are enhanced in predominantly Black and Brown communities and disproportionately arresting them. There’s Innocent incarceration for communities already overpoliced.
                      Additionally, the increased surveillance can induce fear and psychological harm and trigger an exasperate in arrests for crimes on minorities, such as exposing people taking toilet paper from public restrooms. The consequences can be more serious, such as “..lengthy interrogations, watch list placements, tense police encounters, false arrests, or worse.” (TheRegReview). After the profiling and the street-level surveillance, Black people will face inequality in every stage of the criminal punishment system. On trial, predominantly white criminal judges will grant harsh sentences.
                      </p>
                      <p>Whether you were wrongfully incarcerated for a crime you didn’t commit, it has terrible consequences even if it is corrected. In the case of Amara Majeed, she was falsely accused by facial recognition was a suspect in a deadly terrorist attack in Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka authorities corrected the mistake, Majeed and her family received death threats. The government has not drawn the line on how to use the database; will they only search for people who’ve been arrested, or do they get a more extensive database from everyone, such as using driver’s license pictures? There are a few laws and regulations, and some are differed by state. There’s loose regulation on what databases can be used in the system, included in those databases. The situation with the police can scan people’s photos, The systems accuracy and how much the government could share with the public about the technology’s use. Therefore several law enforcement officials don't inform the public that they used facial recognition to find the suspect until the end of the discovery process or at all. the FBI has historically surveilled Black activists and leaders to track and suppress their efforts. Although facial recognition is not used for an arrest and can only be used to develop leads in the investigation, sometimes the police use it to arrest someone. 
                      </p>
                      <p>A solution to reduce algorithmic bias is to have the people who are impacted-- the disabled, people of color, etc-- develop the algorithmic strategies. This will concentrate the focus on trying to make something work and instead focus more on how the tools companies construct impact marginalized communities. The counter communities miss the equitable blindspots in the design they don’t experience. Secondly, law enforcement should adopt what makes Apple facial recognition effective towards all ethnicities--to take photos and videos in three dimensions and invisible infrared light. This will target the issue of innocently incarcerating people due to a limited data set of darker-skinned people. However, a more significant data set means surveillance, a tool to better discriminate against people like immigrants or political protesters, thus putting their freedom at risk. Nevertheless, facial recognition should be used as a lead or part of an investigation process instead of a reason to arrest people, which has happened occasionally. A more radical approach to protect our civil rights is to ban facial recognition and surveillance. Although it won’t stop systemic racism, it is a powerful tool revoked from institutions responsible for upholding it.
