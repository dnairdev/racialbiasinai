                 <p>In this case, Ethics is being discussed regarding technology, things that aren’t directly related to technology must be taken into consideration. Technology is used in daily life, from school to work to social life, technology is present. People are involved in the processes from designing to producing to distributing it. And where people are involved, ethics must be involved too. Ethics are the sole things that stop humans from destroying each other, and are important to making technology a great and useful tool instead of a harmful tool.
                </p>
                <p>In my opinion, ethics should be decided by a group of individuals from around the world, who have different occupations, who all have different economic statuses and who all have demonstrated good ethics throughout their life. We must have a council of citizens, who are well informed on technology, as such to limit it from harming individuals, both physically and mentally. An environmentalist should be in this council, as well as a doctor, and plenty of other individuals. We have to keep in mind that technology isn’t limited to programmers and engineers, it includes people from completely different occupations.
                </p>
                <p>Technology has reached the point that not having it or having access to it, puts one behind not just in society but in everyday life too. Surviving without technology is impossible. It has also been our way of survival during this Covid-19 pandemic. Without technology, society wouldn’t be able to function safely.
                </p>
                <p>Which is why we have to be very careful when deciding what is ethical and what isn’t. Decisions made on ethics affects people on a global scale. A decision made for the U.S. may not be suited for China’s purposes. Everyone’s ethics differ from each other, because our ethics relate to our lives. What affects me doesn’t affect my professor. Ethics have also evolved over time. But all age groups must be counted for when making decisions on ethics.
                </p>
                <p>A lack of ethics reflects badly on a company, a country, and harms the customer. There have been plenty of examples where ethics have been overlooked or ignored when developing a system. One example is face recognition, this hasn’t been spoken much about but some face recognition systems have had some bias programmed into it that is horrible. People with dark skin have been tagged as “Gorilla” on face recognition or haven’t even been detected as a person, but more as a dark shadow. This may not seem like a problem to people who haven’t encountered this situation, but it is a major problem for those who have. And if ethics aren’t considered when implementing them into software, then the situation is just going to get worse.
                </p>
                <p>That was just one example of a situation where the company has claimed to have overlooked things, but there are plenty of situations where people are doing things deliberately and aren’t even trying to hide it. Internet companies have refused to give connection to those who live in areas with a low household income. AI is rapidly being implemented in everyday life but many biases go unchecked. Discrimination occurs because of these unchecked biases. People have been refused houses based on their skin color, which is illegal, minority groups are being targeted online for drugs, the list is endless. This is ethically and morally wrong. Targeting a specific age group to exploit their weakness is not okay. Advertisements that try to get teens to buy drugs or try to give horrible health insurance to the elderly is not okay. That is pure discrimination which has conveniently been left out of the media’s light, so most people who have the power to make a difference are clueless about it.
                </p>
                <p>Deciding with is ethically correct and incorrect is what could solve the problem of discrimination regarding technology globally. That is one step closer to eliminating the major problems of today and letting everyone have an equal opportunity. Not letting certain people have the same access as others is discrimination and ethically isn’t even right. Letting certain people have more access to certain functions with technology than others is unethical, and that is what we have to fix. Which is why having a group of professionals from different backgrounds, economics statuses, races, religions, to decide what is ethical and what is not is what will clear most of these problems.
