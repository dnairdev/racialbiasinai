                 <p>In the article, “Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations”,  researchers identify the racial bias existing in an algorithm used in U.S. healthcare systems. The algorithm is used to identify patients for a high-risk care program. With so many patients, it mainly looks for those who would benefit most from this program, which is assumed to be those with the greatest care needs. As such, it uses data from the past to predict the future, which is shown to lead to problems. The article also stresses the fact that this algorithm only represents an approach which many hospitals take to solving the problem of who gets help and who doesn’t.
                </p>
                <p>However, the study finds that the algorithm has bias against black people. Using data from 2013-2015, they studied the difference between patients identifying as black and patients identifying as white. They find in the data that while black patients have more illness burdens than White patients, yet still have a lower rate of getting the help they need. The data shows that blacks are predicted to be far healthier than they really are, with the consequences being more severe than the algorithm predicts. The researchers even simulated feeding the algorithm more accurate data, showing an increase from 17.7% to 46.5% for patients who would automatically be put into the care program. </p>
                <p>With these findings, they find that there is more disparity in conditional health than in costs between black and white patients. This is surprising since healthier patients should have less costs. However, they note that black patients tend to generate different costs, with less surgical and more emergency room visits as one example. There are many factors which lead to less black patients using the healthcare system, from socioeconomic standings to mistrust, meaning that the data the algorithm was trained with is biased, so the cost predictions the algorithm uses is also biased. Because they spend less, the algorithm doesn’t make them as high of a priority, even though black patients are often more in need of that care. 
                </p>
                <p>To conclude, the researchers believe that there are many other ways to predict who needs care, an example being just to measure their health rather than costs to make less racially biased predictions. Using this idea, they combined health predictions with cost predictions as an index variable, leading to an 84% decrease in racial bias. The researchers are currently working on making their results into a better predictor of health measures, so that it can be applied to the next algorithmic developments. In the end, the study finds that it is the data, mostly it’s labels, that is fed to the algorithm that must change. By doing this, they hope that the risks of algorithmic predictions are low, and it’s benefits are rewarding.
